## Overview
This project explores the use of an Interactive Genetic Algorithms (IGA) as a method of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) within a Unity-based environment.
The video game artifact will be a dungeon-crawling-style game, where the player will move from room to room. Each room will have enemies that the player will have to defeat, as well as loot that the player can acquire, and each room will also be a different scale. On game start, the player will have a choice between random generation or player-driven generation, which will dictate how each room is generated. The player will then be presented with five different options, where the room data is generated randomly, such as the number of enemies and size of the room, and displayed as a preview of the room. The preview will display a User Interface (UI) image of the size of the room and UI text detailing the number of enemies and loot in the room

## Future Work

The next phase of development for this project is divided into two sections: **infrastructure improvements** and **prototype expansion**.

### **1. Continuous Integration Setup (2 Weeks)**  
A continuous integration (CI) pipeline will be introduced. This will include:

- Automated project builds for each commit or pull request  
- Analysis for scripts  
- Automated playmode or editmode tests

Implementing CI will improve development stability.

### **2. Prototype Development (1 Month)**  
The gameplay prototype will be expanded to a complete artifact. Planned extensions include:

- Improved visuals
- Basic combat and loot systems to support gameplay evaluation  
- More data collection 
- More intuitive design
- Further refinement of the IGA to improve player agency

The objective of this phase is to produce a playable vertical slice.
